<h2>Our birth story</h2>
The day before V-day and the day after <a href="http://www.scalinis.com/Bambino.htm">labor-inducing eggplant parmigiana</a>: non-stress test since we hit 41 weeks. V and mama doing fine!
<div class="img"><a href="baby-v-imgs/non-stress-test.jpg"><img src="baby-v-imgs/thumb.non-stress-test.jpg" /></a></div>
<br />
<p>The morning of, Shaun realized she was in labor around 6:00.
After an hour she woke Ian up, "okay. It's 7 o'clock. I no longer feel guilty waking you up. I think today is the day."
This is three weeks since the prodromal labor, and since Nana hopped on the plane to Boston.
Ian, naturally skeptical, but lovingly supportive, calmly replied, "cool, do you need anything?"
She munched through the last of the quiche and cinnamon rolls, and Ian did his morning internet browsing.
Shaun, wide-eyed, asked impatiently, "are you ready for a shower yet?"
During the shower, Shaun's water broke (the doula later said, "how perfect is that?").

<!-- TODO: doggie day care, and the moments before we left (lunch). -->
</p>

<p><!-- TODO: more detailed labor and birth story. -->
More detail coming soon, but a short play-by-play: left Mom (Nana) at home, but made her get a cab before we even got to the birth center.
Kat checked Shaun. 8cm, fully effaced (remarked about the full head of hair she saw). Shaunie vomitted (a good thing) and we headed upstairs and expected to see the nurse, Julie, waiting for us. We called her name, heard no answer, and started looking for our room. When we got there, she opened the door. "Are you Julie?" Ian asked, only slightly annoyed at her non-responsiveness. She was, and we headed in to put our stuff down to settle in.
</p>

<p>
The room was a lot like a bed and breakfast, comfy bed with many pillows.
Cottage-style, almost.
All of the medical equipment was tucked away, out of view.
Shaun remembers laboring on the edge of the bed while waiting for the tub to fill.
She had decided that she wanted V to have a water birth, so she was looking forward to the warm water.
Krystina arrived soon after we went into the room- right on time to do physical support for Shaun.
Ian changed into swim trunks, and the the two of us (three with V) labored together in tub.
Nana arrived around 12:30 and would be present or nearby for the birth.
When she was out of the room, she would listen in and give updates to family via social media.
Long before Shaun and Ian would remember to update people, mom had thankfully contacted the family.
Sometime after Nana arrived (and when Ian and Shaun were in the tub), Shaun remembers someone turned off the lights so that only the natural daylight was filtered into the tub.
She didn't even know the artificial light was bothering her until someone (we think Krystina) helped set the mood.
Peaceful.
Calm.
Relaxing.
Krystina further helped relaxation with a mixture of cold compresses on Shaun's forehead while pouring the warm bath water over her shoulders, arms, and chest.
Ian remembers Shaun telling Krystina how awesome she was for doing this, in a tone that could be easily compared with half-asleep Shaunie.
It was not long before Shaun felt the urge to push (actually Shaun is realizing, in hindsight, that her body was likely already pushing).
Krystina asked if Shaun wanted her to tell Kat, who had stepped out of the room.
Shaun did.
</p>

<p>
Kat came and (like many times throughout) used a doppler to check V's heartbeat.
Strong.
Shaun decided to get out of the tub, and Kat needed to check her cervix.
Kat and Shaun negotiated on a good position to get accurate results, as Shaun was not game for being on her back.
So, as she was lying on her side, Shaun was surprised to hear she's fully dialated and good to go.
While we waited for the water to be replaced in the tub, Shaun labored on the bed and learned that she was not much a fan of counter-pressure.
She appreciated Ian's hip squeezes as they countered the intensity of the contractions.
Ian saw the head.
Shaun has no clue, but is focused now on getting back into the tub.
Together, we went back to tub and pushed for almost two hours.
We're not 100% sure on exact time as we weren't looking at any clocks.
We saw V's long black hair floating in the water for maybe 30 minutes for the final pushes.
Shaun found the whole experience awesome, and (almost completely) pain-free!
Seriously, Shaun kept saying, "This is awesome!" "It doesn't really hurt, it just feels... powerful".
She laughed through quite a bit of the experience, and made funny remarks.
[Kat: Shaun, I can't really catch the baby if you're in that position.
Shaun: Aww. Well, that's too bad for you.
Kat: and bad for the baby, so... move.]
The midwife, nurse, and doula all found the birth remarkable.

<p>Just seconds after birth, mama sees the person from whom she was inseparable for a good part of a year.</p>

<p>The 41-week old placenta shows its calcifications. It was time.</p>

<p>The tree of life shows its vernerable age with dignity. Your service is appreciated, placenta. You may retire.</p>

<p>Shaun had a partial third-degree tear, beyond the skill of our wonderful midwife. We were sent to the hospital for the repair, where V got her stats taken. The nurses took her from the incubation unit used to transfer her through the stormy outdoors, and marvelled at her size. "She's a big one. I'd say at least 9 pounds!" one said as she passed V to the next nurse, "oh ya, she's a chunk!" Ian was proud that Shaun had so fearlessly birthed such a big and strong baby, and found the nurses' exclamations entertaining.</p>

<p>Body heat regulation with skin contact is a great bonding experience as well. Ian is a radiator. A perfect match.</p>

<p>Little V is a natural-born skeptic. Considering her parents, this is to be expected.</p>

<h2>From the doula...</h2>
<p>V's birthday was absolutely the most fun I've had at a birth.

Not only did V wait for a Saturday morning and gave all of us a full night's sleep, but was just stellar at being born! I was thrilled to see Shaun (and Ian) so relaxed and confident, and took so much pleasure in the ways that Shaun herself marveled at how perfectly her body was working.

She had complete trust in her own ability to birth, and I think this had a huge impact on how V came into the world.

The midwife and nurse at the Cambridge Birth Center and I kept looking at each other, just so amazed at the beautiful and joyful birth unfolding before us.

Soon enough, V was crowning, her long silky black hair floating in the bathtub, and kept crowning, and kept crowning, Shaun relaxed, joking and chatting the entire time.

Finally, V was born and plopped into the arms of her happy parents, which I managed to catch on video.

I'm grateful for Shaun, Ian, and V for allowing me to accompany them in this incredible life experience! What a wonderful way to come into the world.</p>
