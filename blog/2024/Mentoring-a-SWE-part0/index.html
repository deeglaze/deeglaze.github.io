This may not follow the narrative structure of a journal, but they are notes to myself. I am not writing this as instructional material, but if you find value in it, do let me know.</p> <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2> <p>I find a mentor/mentee relationship to be effective when it is goal-oriented and time-bounded. When I mentor someone in a professional context, I have three goals, and they’re all about helping a mentee with their goals.</p> <p>Goal 1. Establish context. A mentee should be seeking a mentor to reach a goal. Am I a good fit to help them reach it?</p> <p>Goal 2. determine the areas that need growth in order to reach the goal. Why do they need help reaching their goal?</p> <p>Goal 3. nurture that growth with suggestions, encouragement, and check-ins.</p> <p>I have the explicit non-goal of presenting a rose-tinted view of myself from the mentee’s point of view. I don’t need to feed my ego with someone that looks up to me. I need my mentee to see that flaws and limitations are everpresent in the human experience, but we can still manage to improve upon ourselves.</p> <h2 id="goal-1-establish-context">Goal 1: establish context</h2> <p>Maybe someone wants help formulating <em>more specific</em> goals on their way to their main goal, say, a promotion. This is what I typically have people coming to me for. At Google there are plenty of resources about this. I need folks to dig a little deeper for a more intrinsic career goal.</p> <p>What I find to be fascinating to watch is how unprepared a person is when asked, “would you be happy in that role?” Certainly more money is motivator. The stress of working a role with more responsibilities that you can’t handle may tip the scales away from the cash bump.</p> <p>I need to determine someone’s motivations in order to effectively guide them. As a mentor, there’s no point in my suggesting someone do something they’re entirely unmotivated to do since they likely won’t do it. They won’t try and they won’t improve.</p> <p>Are these person’s motivations even scrutible to me? If so, I might be able to take them on as a mentee.</p> <h2 id="goal-2-identify-growth-areas">Goal 2: identify growth areas</h2> <p>This can take a fair amount of the mentorship time. I need to get to know someone and their concrete struggles to determine where they need help. A meeting with a mentee is typically only 30 minutes, so it’s important to try to drive the conversation away from being just a gripe session.</p> <p>Is this person an arrogant “misunderstood genius”? Is this person too hesitant about their own ideas to try to advance them? Is this person stuck in a rut and looking for a way out of a common grind?</p> <p>I can only do so much with our limited time together that I try to pick out just a couple aspects to work on, with concrete goals attached. If a mentee and I can agree on what to prioritize to work on, then we can get to work.</p> <h2 id="goal-3-nurture-growth">Goal 3: nurture growth</h2> <p>I will try to have my mentee internalize the three Hs:</p> <ul> <li>Be Humble.</li> <li>Be Helpful.</li> <li>Be Hungry.</li> </ul> <p>I find that staying humble will improve your relationships with people. People are generally more willing to hear you out when they like you.</p> <p>To be more than likeable, I think you need to contribute something more than comic relief–to be helpful. Being helpful doesn’t just mean picking up an on-call shift for someone going on vacation. Helpfulness can extend to all areas of the team and the business, depending on how you structure your help.</p> <p>If you’re “fat and happy”, you have little motivation to improve. Therefore, I find that keeping momentum in self improvement requires carrying an intrinsic amount of hunger to have a greater impact.</p> <h2 id="closing-time">Closing time</h2> <p>I plan to go into more detail about how I go about achieving my goals as a mentor in later posts. Next, I want to detail some goals folks have had (abstractly) and how I went about or would go about getting more information about them.</p> </body></html>
