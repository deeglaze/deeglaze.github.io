Many of the hallmarks of dynamic languages such as closures, continuations, various forms of reflection, and a lack of static types make many programmers rejoice, while compiler writers, tool developers, and verification engineers lament. The dynamism of these features simply confounds statically reasoning about programs that use them. Consequently, static analyses for dynamic languages are few, far between, and seldom sound."},{"name":"Pushdown flow analysis with abstract garbage collection","publisher":"Journal of Functional Programming","releaseDate":"2014","url":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-functional-programming/article/pushdown-flow-analysis-with-abstract-garbage-collection/92567231A16859F51056AB6F6781ACAE","summary":" In the static analysis of functional programs, pushdown flow analysis and abstract garbage collection push the boundaries of what we can learn about programs statically. This work illuminates and poses solutions to theoretical and practical challenges that stand in the way of combining the power of these techniques. Pushdown flow analysis grants unbounded yet computable polyvariance to the analysis of return-flow in higher-order programs. Abstract garbage collection grants unbounded polyvariance to abstract addresses which become unreachable between invocations of the abstract contexts in which they were created. Pushdown analysis solves the problem of precisely analyzing recursion in higher-order languages; abstract garbage collection is essential in solving the “stickiness” problem. Alone, our benchmarks demonstrate that each method can reduce analysis times and boost precision by orders of magnitude."}],"skills":[{"name":"Static Analysis","level":"Expert"},{"name":"Cryptographic Protocols","level":"Practitioner"}],"languages":[{"language":"English","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"Japanese","fluency":"Conversational","icon":""}],"interests":[{"name":"Theorem proving","icon":"fa-solid fa-tag"}],"references":[{"name":"Professor David Van Horn","icon":"fa-solid fa-laptop","reference":"Ph.D. advisor"},{"name":"Shanshan Qu","icon":"fa-solid fa-thumbtack","reference":"Software engineering manager"}],"projects":[{"name":"gce-tcb-verifier","summary":"Code-signing and verification tool for virtual firmware","highlights":["Confidential Computing"],"startDate":"2023-06-01","endDate":"Now","url":"https://github.com/google/gce-tcb-verifier"},{"name":"go-sev-guest","summary":"AMD SEV-SNP attestation report collection and verification.","highlights":["Confidential Computing"],"startDate":"2022-04-15","endDate":"Now","url":"https://github.com/google/go-sev-guest"}]}
