  <h3>Concrete Semantics for Pushdown Analysis: The Essence of Summarization</h3>

  <p>Pushdown analysis is better than finite-state analysis in
precision and performance. Why then have we not seen total widespread
adoption of these techniques? For one, the known techniques are
technically burdened and difficult to understand or extend. Control
structure of the programming language gets pulled into the model of
computation, which makes extensions to non-pushdown control
structures, such as <font id="racket">call/cc</font>
or <font id="racket">shift</font> and <font id="racket">reset</font>,
non-trivial.  We show a derivational approach to abstract
interpretation that yields transparently sound static analyses that
can precisely match calls and returns when applied to well-known
abstract machines. We show that adding memoization and segmenting the
continuation into bounded pieces leads to machines that abstract to
static analyses for context-free reachability by simply bounding the
stores. This technique allows us to derive existing, more technically
involved analyses, and a novel pushdown analysis for delimited,
composable control.</p>
