# Trustworthy computation

Confidential Computing has a selling point that has not been realized in hyperscalers: by using this technology, you can know exactly what the service you're talking to will do with the data you give it.
To "truly know" is a subjective concept that often tends to push folks to demand smaller and smaller codebases written and reviewed by trusted experts.
So we build brick by brick, claim by claim, relationship by relationship.

There is nothing about this vision of trust that is specific to confidential computing.
Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) have existed for over a decade to provide similar guarantees, right?
In some sense yes, in others no.

Wait, you say, isn't this what Trusted Platform Modules were supposed to do?
Isn't this secure boot?
Integrity Measurement Architecture (Linux's IMA)?


What are the foundational technological boulders for supporting the pillars of trust in remote computing?
Who is building them?
How far along are we?


This is kind of the same story that is told in the formal methods community: the software you're running is "correct" because a smart person or group of people proved it with math.
