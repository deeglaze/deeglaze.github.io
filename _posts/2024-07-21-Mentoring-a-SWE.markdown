I think a lot of us, as adults, have looked around hoping that a "real adult" would come and fix things.
Surely, someone will do the grown-up thing.
Someone will change the minds of the people that are stopping you from achieving your goal, or have that special knowledge which will fix the difficult problem you're having.

This is not a growth mindset.
Waiting for your savior is learned helplessness.

## Growth

You will not jump from junior programmer to CTO overnight, unless you start your own company and give yourself that title.
If you do, best of luck on your venture.

If you're risk-averse like me, you're trying to climb the corporate ladder.
Your growth trajectory is unlikely to be a linear X years until Level + 1.
Continuous growth takes continuous effort beyond your current duties.
That isn't to say you should work more than you've agreed to, but it could mean taking personal time for reflection.
Digest your experiences into lessons and not just gripes.
Choose to not blame others when the problem could be in the quality of your own work.

## Respect

A typical software engineer works in a team.
You may find that fixing your attitude will open

You will need mentorship, and you will need opportunity.
To grow into a role with more responsibilities, you need to stretch yourself
If you want to grow into a leader, you need to accept that They are not coming.


If you're a junior programmer, you don't have to take the reigns of a whole team as your next step, but

Leaders are not saviors

This mentality

Be humble, be helpful, and be hungry.
This is the advice given to folks that seek to grow and achieve better things.
I was none of these in a way that counted.
I'd like to expand on this pithy line, from my own experience.

I started programming in 6th grade at 12 years old.
I kept it up through high school and made computer game engines and tools.
I even managed to make a couple games, though it turns out making something fun is a lot less math and a lot more fussing than I was interested in.
In comparison to other students in college, I was more capable.
I knew more things.
I tested well.
I felt that my ability to perform well in class made me superior, and that didn't make me popular.
Through arrogance, I alienated every other student I interacted with, unless they were even better than me.
The few who did better just avoided me, since that's the smart thing to do when you want to avoid wasting energy.
Be humble, and you might be able to achieve greater than with a team than you could alone.

I've been programming professionally for 22 years, which include my time in higher education, so not all of it was full time.
I've been at Google for 7 years, and before that I was at LogicBlox, Inc. for 18 months.
My other jobs were internships and contract work.
I have another 25-30 years of work ahead of me.
I'm not a unicorn 10x rockstar ninja code warrior.
My wisdom is born of scars and not genius deduction from first principles.
I am an L5 SWE at Google, which is a senior role that is influential but not necessarily a product leader.
The L5 role is terminal for a lot of folks.
Higher levels come with significant shifts in responsibility that the majority of engineers do not want or don't have the opportunity to have when compared with the rest of the labor market.

When I mentor engineers, they are usually levels 3, 4, or an early 5.
My advice is not a rare candy that instantly levels you up.
Like every skill in life, work is required to improve.
I can point people in certain directions and suggest that the path might take them where they want to go, but at the same time I can't predict how far that path will take them.
Google values teamwork, which requires communication skills that we math-types didn't necessarily excel at in school.


A previous manager I had, Matt Gingell, was L4 when I was hired as L4.
Matt became our project lead and was promoted to L5, and then transitioned to Technical Lead and Manager (TLM).
I don't think TLM is a role anymore since it just... was two jobs that you couldn't do well in both at the same time.
Matt had told me that when he got his promotion and was in his new role for a couple years, "it's a hot dog eating contest, and the prize for winning is more hot dogs."
This has stuck with me as I contemplate my career trajectory.
People come to me for mentorship to learn how they can achieve a promotion, and I don't think any of my mentees have gotten promoted.



I consider myself average in capability and above average in drive, though that's in relation to my peers at Google.
I work in security and have a couple certifications, but my PhD is in programming languages, their semantics, and automated reasoning about them.
The most capable software engineers in the world are among my colleagues at Google, so there's a certain amount of humbling that happens as a result of working alongside them.
I may never reach that level of capability, and in all likelihood will not.
I can only aspire to be better than I was yesterday.
