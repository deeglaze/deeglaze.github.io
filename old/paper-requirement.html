<h3>Paper Requirement for James Ian Johnson</h3>
<ol>
  <li><b>Paper:</b> J. Ian Johnson, Nicholas Labich, Matthew Might and David Van Horn, "Correctly Optimizing Abstract Abstract Machines", ICFP (2013)</li>
  <li><b>Description:</b> A derivational approach to transforming programming language semantics in the form of abstract machines to performant implementations, with each step proven correct and evaluated on a respectible set of benchmarks.</li>
  <li><b>Acceptance rate:</b> 30% (40/133)</li>
  <li><b>Student's contributation to paper:</b> All proofs of correctness, all optimization passes except abstract compilation, the implementation and performance evaluation. Co-wrote the paper with Might and Van Horn and mentored Labich (NEU undergraduate) in rewriting a singleton variable analysis that I had written for a previous project.</li>
  <li><b>URL for paper:</b> <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3722">arXiv.org</a></li>
  <li><b>Why should this paper be accepted as qualifying the paper requirement:</b> It demonstrates that Ian can construct and perform large-scale experiments to validate his further mathematical work in derivational approaches to scaling up program analyses.</li>
  <li><b>Advisor:</b> Olin Shivers and David Van Horn are my co-advisors.</li>
