  <p>The technique of <i>abstracting abstract machines</i> (AAM) provides a
     systematic approach for deriving computable approximations of
     evaluators that are easily proved sound. This article contributes a
     complementary step-by-step process for subsequently going from a naive
     analyzer derived under the AAM approach, to an efficient and correct
     implementation. The end result of the process is a two to three
     order-of-magnitude improvement over the systematically derived
     analyzer, making it competitive with hand-optimized implementations
     that compute fundamentally less precise results.</p>
