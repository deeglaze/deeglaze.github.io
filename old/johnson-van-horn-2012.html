    <p>
      Formalisms for context-free approaches to higher-order control-flow analysis are complex and require significant effort to prove correct.
      However, these approaches are enticing because they provide improved precision over finite state approaches. We present a new method for
      deriving context-free analyses that results in &ldquo;obviously correct&rdquo; formalisms that consists of making small changes to the original
      concrete semantics. We validate this method by using it to derive existing context-free analyses from abstract machines. We further exercise the
      technique by applying it to abstract machines that more closely represent real language implementations and consequently derive analyses more
      precise than existing ones. Specifically, we use an escape analysis to derive better stack allocation, and use garbage collection to derive
      better heap allocation. We also present a novel semantics for <font id="racket">call/cc</font> that, when turned into an analysis, handles
      non-escaping continuations more precisely than prior treatments of first-class control.
